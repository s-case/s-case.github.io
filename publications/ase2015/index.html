        <h3>From Requirements to Source Code: A Model-Driven Engineering Approach for RESTful Web Services</h3>
      <p>
        This page keeps the files required for reproducing our case study in paper:<br /> 
        From Requirements to Source Code: A Model-Driven Engineering Approach for RESTful Web Services<br /> 
        submitted to the Special Issue: Realizing AI Synergies in Software Engineering in the Journal of Automated Software Engineering
      </p>
      <p>
        The case study involves project Restmarks, a service that allows users to store and retrieve online their bookmarks, share them with other users and search for bookmarks by using tags.<br />
        The elements of the project include:
        <ul>
          <li>Functional requirements, available <a href="./Requirements.rqs">here</a>.</li>
          <li>Storyboards, available <a href="./Storyboards.zip">here</a>.</li>
          <li>The YAML file, produced by the aggregated ontology upon instantiating it from multimodal types of requirements, available <a href="./Restmarks.yaml">here</a>.</li>
          <li>The CIM, constructed using as input the YAML file, available <a href="./CIMModels.zip">here</a>.</li>
          <li>The PIM, constructed using as input the CIM, available <a href="./PIMModels.zip">here</a>.</li>
          <li>The PSM, constructed using as input the PIM, available <a href="./PSMModels.zip">here</a>.</li>
          <li>The produced code of the service, constructed using as input the PSM, available <a href="./MDEGeneratedCode.zip">here</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the full definition of the PIM/PSM meta-models and the M2M transformations described in the manuscript can be found at deliverable D2.2 of S-CASE, available <a href="./S-CASE_D2.2.pdf">here</a>.
