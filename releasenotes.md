### Version: 1.2

_Date of release: 24/11/2015_

- MDE UI Update. Now the Core CIM Wizard of MDE allows the S-CASE developer to rename Resources and Properties. The openproject issue can be found [here](https://openproject.scasefp7.com/work_packages/19) and the github entry [here](https://github.com/s-case/mde/commit/8fd9bdd45e83fb5b17cde6cf0536f4b33db91cf3)
- MDE bug fix. The S-CASE developer cannot select as Naming Property a Property that is collection anymore. [opernproject](https://openproject.scasefp7.com/work_packages/30) and [github](https://github.com/s-case/mde/commit/6b279902686191ef6e7bea111850b83abf784df5)
- MDE bug fix. The MDE engine produces now code without duplicate local variables in the "deleteAllCollections" function in any case. Previously, should there exist multiple Collection attributes, the result was several local variables with the same name which resulted in building failure. [opernproject](https://openproject.scasefp7.com/work_packages/30) and [github](https://github.com/s-case/mde/commit/6b279902686191ef6e7bea111850b83abf784df5)
- MDE bug fix. Now the MDE engine produces the correct code when some resources have attributes that are Sets of Integers or Doubles. This does not apply to the modeling of the input/output of external services. That will be fixed in the next release. [opernproject](https://openproject.scasefp7.com/work_packages/30) and [github](https://github.com/s-case/mde/commit/6b279902686191ef6e7bea111850b83abf784df5)
- Web Service Composition Update. Now the WSC plugin supports (HTTP GET) RESTful web services with Basic Authentication. [opernproject](https://openproject.scasefp7.com/work_packages/50) and [github](https://github.com/s-case/web-service-composition/commit/95cf8bfce0073b88fa341df0e7a01a6d1da70096)
- Web Service Composition Update. Now the WSC plugin supports the connection of the generated RESTful web services to the MDE Ontology (LinkedOntology). [github](https://github.com/s-case/web-service-composition/commit/5737b3d8be6e6a059e7cd58e51e9a4d8c55f712b)
- Web Service Composition Update. New ontology repository, including RESTful services, is used. [github](https://github.com/s-case/web-service-composition/commit/41c1e079c5e8cd3305a9e207da9c58eb033dfda7)
- Created functionality for stemming noun constructs (e.g. "virtual machines" is stemmed as "virtual machine"). Open-project [issue](https://openproject.scasefp7.com/work_packages/68) Github [entry](https://github.com/s-case/s-case-core/commit/8a1d15b0c147327556b9c0bf64dbccd7588c9d7d)
- Updated dynamic ontology API to be more robust in case of erroneous annotations. GitHub [entry](https://github.com/s-case/s-case-core/commit/ea7d0ee7d8bd21db8daebf89b7789e966e94287a)
- Minor update in stemmer noun extensions. GitHub [entry](https://github.com/s-case/s-case-core/commit/aa78eed866936f50cfc0cc737dec9bfee50a8ea6)

### Version: 1.1

_Date of release: 16/11/2015_

- Minor UI Update. Changed the "Unique" check box button logic from the Core CIM Wizard and External Service Composition to "Collection". When the "Collection" check box is checked the corresponding property will be an Array, otherwise of multiplicity 1. Corresponding open-project [issue](https://openproject.scasefp7.com/work_packages/52) Github [entry](https://github.com/s-case/mde/commit/8a4cd32aa08c8b94d27d0bea552c0057a56b3624)
- UI Wizards Logic Update. Update the validation checks of all the MDE Wizards. With these updates, the S-CASE developer is promted to create the appropriate minimum number of algorithmic resources, depending on his project preferences. For example, if the "Searching Functionality" is checked in the project preferences, the S-CASE developer will no longer be able to finish the CIM Wizard step, unless he creates at least one algorithmic resource. In the same manner, the Search CIM Wizard and the the External Services CIM Wizard perform the corresponding checks and do not allow the developers to create more or less resources of the corresponding type than they should. Corresponding open-project [issue](https://openproject.scasefp7.com/work_packages/30) Github [entry](https://github.com/s-case/mde/commit/b040c942f057cbef31ef38efa3761ca1fbe37bc7)
- Web.xml update. Changed the servlet mapping url pattern from `<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>` to `<url-pattern>/api/*</url-pattern>`. That allows S-CASE developer to also add the client application in the same folder. Open-project [issue](https://openproject.scasefp7.com/work_packages/59) Github [entry](https://github.com/s-case/mde/commit/1b90c0624608d4cc76eb4616d0b502ab05f4d085)
- Moved Lucene indexes location. Moved the produced Lucene indexes location (if the S-CASE developer opted to add Searching functionality) to a new folder named as `[WebServiceName]LuceneIndexes` instead of simply `WebServiceName`. This resolves an issue that sometimes occured when a newer version of the .WAR file is pasted in servlet's webapp folder, which resulted in overriding of the existing Lucene indexes, thus Search resources would no more include previously added data to their query results sets. Github [entry](https://github.com/s-case/mde/commit/008af915507895a583f851f512737741f847938c)
- Code Generation 2nd run logic. This is a major update that allows S-CASE developers to select to re-rerun the "Generate Code" functionality by taking as input the ecore models produced in the previous MDE run. This pretty much drastically reduces the amount of work the S-CASE developer has to do when he simply wants to make modifications to his previous work. It must be stressed out that this does not apply to modifications to Requirements/Storyboards etc. For the time being, this is supported for anything edited through the MDE Wizards. Example applications of 2nd run logic: An S-CASE developer builds a first version of his system but then realizes that should also add Authentication. This can from now be done by simply adding the new Authentication input. All the other Wizards will be restored to their previous state. Another example is adding new resources, or modifying existing ones, removing functionality layers or performing any update. In any case the Wizards will reload any data that is still valid after any modifications done by the S-CASE developer. Open-project corresponding [issue](https://openproject.scasefp7.com/work_packages/51) Github [entry](https://github.com/s-case/mde/commit/845c5055e6c4ebf14882c99836033783c5179d0d)
- Fixed bug of Web Service Composition plugin, relevant to reading a property file. Open-project corresponding [issue](https://openproject.scasefp7.com/work_packages/60) Github [entry](https://github.com/s-case/web-service-composition/commit/4e52ee7167dc09c83ce731760fd67cc4022ed02d)
- Added support for annotating UML use case and activity diagrams in Requirements Editor. Github [entry](https://github.com/s-case/requirements-editor/commit/e87fa602eb85a77a038aa80f86873b8945dbd71a)
- Fixed bug related to saving storyboards in Storyboard Creator. Github [entry](https://github.com/s-case/storyboard-creator/commit/1650a97e3cc5f41c892fa5981ed714219c3e07f8)
